Instructions for operating the InventoryBot v1.0,
which adds inventory items to Cougar Mountain automatically.


Steps:
 1. Open Cougar Mountain in the Network desktop app and log into the HER server.
    Make sure the window is not full screen, but that it is big enough
    for all of the stock maintenance information to be visible.
 2. Move the stock Excel file into the folder "bot_data". The file should have one item per row,
    with the box # of each row matching a sign number.
 3. Change the Excel file name to "stock.xls" or "stock.xlsx".
 4. Copy the signs text data into a text file called "signs.txt".
    The signs text should have numbers followed by text data. For example:

    34
    Beautiful ornate gold trim necklace, only $29.95.

    35
    Biomorphic green glass vase, ONLY $9999.99. (In other countries this would be $99999.99!)

 5. If there is a file called "finished.txt" in the bot_data folder, delete it.
 6. Move the signs.txt file into the folder "bot_data".
 7. Double-click on the file "inventory_bot.py" on the desktop.
 8. At this point, the program may show some messages on screen talking about the inventory data.
  i.   If the message says: "Please save the signs data..." or "Please save the stock spreadsheet..."
       then the spreadsheet and signs information was not saved in the right folder or was saved
       with the wrong name.
  ii.  If the message says: "No entries found in the spreadsheet" then the program was unable to find
       any inventory information in the spreadsheet. Please contact Colin if this happens.
  iii. If the message says: "No sign data for [number]" then the program could not find the sign
       for the item in the spreadsheet with Box # [number]. Click OK to accept (the program will 
       skip entering the notes information) or Cancel to stop the program.
  iv.  If the message says: "Price mismatch for [number]" then the program detected that the
       price for the row with box # [number] does not match the sign with that number. It will
       automatically read the sign and try to find the right price, and display it on screen.
       Click OK if the guess is correct and you would like to keep it, New Price if you would like
       to manually enter the correct price or Cancel to stop the program.
 9. After the message boxes stop, the program will start moving and clicking.
    At this point, you just need to wait for a Telegram message.
  i.  The message should say "Finished entering..." indicating the program is finished!
  ii. If the message does not arrive after a long time, check the screen to see if there was an error.

IF YOU EVER NEED TO STOP THE PROGRAM FOR ANY REASON, USE WIN + DOWN TO MINIMIZE THE WINDOW.
THIS WILL PREVENT THE PROGRAM FROM PERFORMING ANY ACTIONS.
IF YOU NEED TO RESTART THE INVENTORY PROGRAM AFTER STOPPING IT, JUST DOUBLE-CLICK ON THE
inventory_bot.py FILE AGAIN -- IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY IGNORE ITEMS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ENTERED.
(THIS IS THE PURPOSE OF THE finished.txt FILE.)
