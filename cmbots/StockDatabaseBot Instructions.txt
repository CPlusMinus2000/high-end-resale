Instructions for operating the StockDatabaseBot v1.0,
which reads database items from Cougar Mountain automatically.


Steps:
 1. Open Cougar Mountain in the Network desktop app and log into the HER server.
    Make sure the window is not full screen, but that it is big enough
    for all of the stock maintenance information to be visible.
 2. If you already have a partially complete stock database Excel file,
    save it in the folder "bot_data" with the name "stock_database.xlsx".
 3. Double-click on the file "stock_database_bot.py" on the desktop.
 4. At this point, the program may show some messages on screen talking about the inventory data.
  i.  If the message says: "Please save the stock spreadsheet..."
      then the spreadsheet and signs information was not saved in the right folder or was saved
      with the wrong name.
  ii. For other error messages, try to fix the error based on the message.
      If it doesn't make any sense, please contact Colin.
 5. After the message boxes stop, the program will start moving and clicking.
    At this point, you just need to wait for the printer to stop making noises.
    Check the screen periodically -- if you see an error message, then the program failed
    (it might have been unable to find a certain image).

IF YOU EVER NEED TO STOP THE PROGRAM FOR ANY REASON, USE WIN + DOWN TO MINIMIZE THE WINDOW.
THIS WILL PREVENT THE PROGRAM FROM PERFORMING ANY ACTIONS.
IF YOU NEED TO RESTART THE BARCODE PROGRAM AFTER STOPPING IT, JUST DOUBLE-CLICK ON THE
barcode_bot.py FILE AGAIN -- IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY IGNORE ITEMS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN FOUND.
